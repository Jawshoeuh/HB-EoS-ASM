# Easier Status Checker Check
This patch is unzipped as it is intended to be uses a a basis for creating your own patch that fits the specific needs of your game. Easier Status Checker Check is a rewrite of the original function that makes it easier to modify the check you want a specific move to do. I have included a few extra checks that don't exist in the base game for convenience. If you need more space in StatusCheckerCheck than it can fit, please use the ExtraSpace patch (overlay36).

# SnowGen9
This patch removes the increasced speed from snow and repurposes that space to instead bolster the defense of Ice types in the damage calculation formula. <br/>
